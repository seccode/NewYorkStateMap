Map of New York State

This map was created as a tool to visualize and analyze features of New York State. It utilizes the Mapbox SDK and various geographic data resources from New York State, Cornell University, as well as several Federal agencies.

The list of layers that the map is able to display are as follows:
-School Districts
-Basic Census and Advanced Census Data (Blocks and Tracts)
-Congressional Districts
-State Assembly Districts
-State Senate Districts
-Counties
-Cities/Towns
-Indian Territory

-Empire Zones (Economic Incentive Program)
-Railroad lines
-Traffic density lines
-Watershed Classifications
-DEC owned land (Department of Environmental Conservation)
-LWRP (Local Waterfront Revitilization Program)
-Water well locations
-Critical Environmental Zones
-Aquifers
-Eco-Zones
-North-South Hunting Line
-Water Dam locations
-Phosphorus protected watersheds
-Black Bear Ranges
-Snowmobile Trails
-Adirondacks Boundaries
-New York City Zoning Regions
-Tax Parcel data for New York counties:
  1. Cayuga
  2. Cortland
  3. Genesee
  4. Greene
  5. Cayuga
  6. Lewis
  7. Ontario
  8. Rensselaer

* I am in the process of getting data from other counties, but unfortunately the ones listed are the only that open source their tax parcel data. I filed a FOIL Request in New York State to get the rest of the data (other counties charge thousands of dollars for this data), and am in the appeals process of my request, but it seems futile. Will update.
